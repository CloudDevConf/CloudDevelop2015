Abstract:

Anyone working near a computer likely hears the term “Big Data” thrown around an awful lot these days.  And you may have also heard phrases like “I’ve heard using Big Data can detect fraud and increase sales!” or “The entire solution is Open Source, so we don’t need to license anything!”.  While there may be some truth buried in those statements, there is a lot of information to cover in-between.  Through this presentation, we will walk through some of the key concepts around Big Data technologies, including an overview of architecture, practical business application and how companies are putting these tools to work.  With a more clear understand of Big Data and the types of technologies that support it, we will look to outline why there is so much excitement in the marketplace and how nearly anyone can leverage these tools and services to make their data do more.
