Abstract:

Wouldn't it be nice to know that your website is broken or slow before your customers tell you? Of course it would! Microsoft Application Insights for Visual Studio is a suite of tools designed to help teams derive key metrics (performance, usage, availability, etc.) from their modern applications. In this talk we will add Application Insights to new or existing Visual Studio projects. We will then use it in conjunction with Microsoft Azure to monitor and test these applications. Finally, we will learn how to access and read the metrics gathered so you and your team get pinpoint data to fix any problem.
