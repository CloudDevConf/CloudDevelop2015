### Abstract:

Everyone is talking about the cloud & mobile – the new age. All the while, a voice inside your head screams ‘What about my existing on-premises data?’ Enterprise developers often deal with huge amounts of relational data in legacy databases and moving to the public cloud entails legitimate concerns.Relax. Your on-premises data can happily coexist with the modern cloud – you just need the right bridges. You can expose your data securely for consumption/updates from any device – web, mobile or desktop. In this talk, we look at two enticing options – Azure Hybrid Connections and Telerik Data Connectors. You’ll walk away with real-world scenarios of freeing up your on-premises data. Your data and your services powering modern apps!
