An Introduction to Azure Service Fabric 
=================

**Abstract**
Ever wonder how Microsoft builds highly distributed services like Azure DocumentDB, Azure SQL DB, or even Cortana? Each of these services has a specialized purpose, but they share the need to be highly scalable, reliable and have extremely low latency. Azure Service Fabric is the platform under all of them, and it is purpose-built to solve exactly these challenges. More importantly, it is now available for you to build your own highly-scalable, reliable, low-latency services on top of! Come see how Azure Service Fabric fits into the myriad of compute options offered by the Azure platform and if it is a good fit for your solutions. We'll look at how you can build either stateful, or stateless, microservices using this platform and how it differs from Azure Cloud Services.


**Resources**
You can find more information about [Service Fabric on the Azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/service-fabric/) website. Get started by [pulling down the SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-fabric-get-started/).

Remember that as of the time of this presentation Azure Service Fabric was in preview and the SDK allowed only a local development cluster. Cloud based services and technologies move very quickly. If it's been more than a month or two since this deck has been posted you'll likely want to skip any of the resources listed here and go straight to the newest documentation you can find.
