Abstract:

How can you convince decision-makers to take new initiatives to the cloud? In this session we will consider how the low cost, high scalability and high reliability of the cloud make it a valuable option for any enterprise. We will discuss the business benefits of PaaS/IaaS, rapid prototyping, security, business continuity, disaster recovery, and hybrid connectivity.

We will also discuss the psychology behind change and how to make it happen.
